User management
-------------------
ramesh joined devops team

1. create user
useradd <user-name>
passwd <user-name>

/etc/passwd --> will have user entries
when a user is created, automatically group is created with same username

getent groups
/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> enable password authentication
sshd -t --> checks for syntax of the file
systemctl restart sshd --> 

2. group create

groupadd <group-name>

3. every user will have a primary group and secondary group

ramesh should be added to devops group

usermod -g devops ramesh

chown --> even file owner can't run this commands
only sudo user can change the ownership
chown <user>:<group> file-name
chown <user>:<group> -R folder

4. we will create testing group, we will give ramesh secondary access to testing

usermod -aG testing ramesh

gpasswd -d ramesh testing --> deletes ramesh from testing group

user is leaving organisation
------------------------------
userdel <user-name> --> removes user from linux

first user should be removed from the group

1. project release
2. company release


process management
----------------------------
if you follow process you will get best results

everything in linux is a process...

Team Leader
Team Manager
Account Manager
Senior Engineer
Junior Engineer
Trainee

Team Leader --> 1 ticket created about devops pipelines setup = 1

Senior Engineer --> 1

sub task -> 2 --> Junior Engineer
sub task -> 3 --> Junior Engineer-2

Junior Engineer - 2 
---------------
sub task --> 4 --> trainee
create a CI pipeline --> task completed
ticket 4 --> task completed

task ID --> 4 , parent task --> 3
task 3 --> task 1

whatever we do in linux --> a process id will be created and reported back

ps

echo Hello --> print Hello task given to Linux

I need to create a process ID
2345 --> result is hand overed to bash terminal 3720

foreground process --> block terminal
background process --> runs in background &

when process stucks we need to kill it

kill PID --> process may or may not be terminated

when process stuck even kill can't kill it

kill -9 --> forcefully terminate

nodejs project
----------------

ps -ef | grep nodejs


package management
-----------------------
yum command is used to install packages --> RHEL = centos = fedora = AWS Linux 2
amazon-linux-extras
yum install package-name

apt-get
