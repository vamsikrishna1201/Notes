DevOps is a process and methodology


faster releases, less defects --> 
fast and accuracy

SMS --> school management system

follow best process, you will get best results
process should be continously updated

teachers --> they will start covering syllabus
students --> prepare from one month

less than 50%

1 fullround test --> Ferrari --> ambassdor

Unit tests and term exams/Agile

DevOps is a process of developing, deploying and testing on the same day. For example if a developer develops 100 lines of code, we can deploy it and test in on the same day. We will get immidiate results, we can fix them. in this process developers, testing and operations guys are working together.

as a devops I can concentrate on faster release with less defects.
